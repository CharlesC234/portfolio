                            <p style={{fontSize: '15px'}}>During my time at Florida Polytechnic I have learned a tremendous amount. Initially I studied Electrical Engineering, but eventually switched my major, as I found that Computer Science aligned more with what I really wanted to do as well as my dreams of entrepreneurship. I would highly recommend the Computer Science program at Florida Polytechnic, I have had great hands on experience in the field, and amazing professors. Overall I feel it has adequately preppared me for the industry.</p>
