					subTitle="I'm currently a Junior at Florida Polytechnic University in Lakeland, Florida, majoring in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering. My tech journey started with a love for creating and evolved into a passion for coding in high school. I believe that success in software engineering is achievable with just an idea, strong passion, and dedicated effort. This belief fuels my studies and personal projects. In this field, your imagination is the only limit. As I seek internships and refine my skills, I'm excited to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals who share a similar vision for pushing the boundaries of what's possible through software."

Most of my projects have been focused on building web applications, as that is what I would like to do in the future. Below you will see some of my featured projects, the majority of my work is in JavaScript, utlizing the React or NextJS frameworks. Make sure to check out the projects page to see all my projects."
